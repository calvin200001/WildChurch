## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/calvin200001/WildChurch.git
    cd WildChurch
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js**: Use Node.js v18. You can use `nvm` (Node Version Manager):
    ```bash
    nvm install 18
    nvm use 18
    ```
    (The project includes a `.nvmrc` file for convenience).
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```
    (The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is used to resolve some dependency conflicts).
4.  **Set up `.env.local`**: Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your local development environment variables (same keys as Netlify, but you can use placeholder VAPID keys for local testing if push notifications aren't critical).

## ‚úÖ Implemented Fixes & Improvements

This section summarizes the recent development efforts to address critical issues and enhance the application's stability and user experience.

*   **RPC Function for Pins (`get_pins_json`):** Provided SQL to create the `get_locations_geojson()` RPC function (later renamed to `get_pins_json`) in Supabase, essential for map pin data retrieval.
*   **User Profile Modal Loading:** Modified `UserProfileModal.jsx` to use `.maybeSingle()` for graceful profile loading, preventing the modal from hanging when a profile doesn't exist.
*   **Profile Loading Race Conditions:** Refactored profile fetching logic in `App.jsx` to consolidate calls, prevent race conditions, and ensure consistent loading states. This also included implementing auto-creation of profiles for new users.
*   **Header Component Profile Prop Handling:** Updated `App.jsx` and `Header.jsx` to consistently pass and handle `profile` and `profileLoading` props, ensuring correct display of user information and loading states in the header.
*   **Messaging System Stability:** Rewrote `fetchConversations` logic and `useEffect` dependencies in `ConversationList.jsx` to improve messaging stability and correct data fetching for conversation lists.
*   **UserSearch Component Import Fix:** Added the missing `User` icon import to `UserSearch.jsx`.
*   **Conversation View Avatar Display:** Modified message display to correctly show sender avatars and updated `fetchMessages` to include sender profile data in `ConversationView.jsx`.
*   **Global Loading States:** Created a reusable `ProfileLoading.jsx` component and integrated it into `ConversationList.jsx` to provide better visual feedback during data fetching.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Created an `ErrorBoundary.jsx` component and wrapped the main `Routes` in `App.jsx` to provide a more robust error handling mechanism.
*   **Database Trigger for Auto-Profile Creation:** Provided SQL to create the `handle_new_user()` trigger in Supabase, automating profile creation for new users.
*   **Supabase Client Bypasses (Direct Fetch Implementations):** Due to persistent hanging issues with the `@supabase/supabase-js` client library, several key data fetching and storage operations have been transitioned to direct `fetch` API calls:
    *   `supabase.rpc('get_pins_json')` in `UserPinLayer.jsx` was replaced with a direct `fetch` call.
    *   `supabase.from('locations').select(...).single()` in `PinDetailsModal.jsx` was replaced with a direct `fetch` call.
    *   `supabase.from('profiles').select(...).maybeSingle()` in `UserProfileModal.jsx` was replaced with a direct `fetch` call.
    *   `supabase.storage.from('avatars').upload(...)` in `UserProfileModal.jsx` was replaced with a direct `fetch` call.
    *   `supabase.from('conversation_participants').select(...)` in `ConversationList.jsx` was replaced with a direct `fetch` call.

## üöß Remaining Issues & Future Enhancements

This section outlines known issues, areas for further investigation, and potential future enhancements.

*   **Supabase Client Library Investigation**: The recurring need to bypass the `@supabase/supabase-js` client library with direct `fetch` calls for various operations (RPC, `select`, storage) indicates a deeper underlying incompatibility or bug with the client library in this specific environment/setup. A thorough investigation into the root cause of these hanging issues is recommended.
*   **Remaining Supabase Client Usage Review**: All remaining uses of the `@supabase/supabase-js` client library should be reviewed. Specifically, the following functions still use the client and may require conversion to direct `fetch` calls if they exhibit similar hanging/failure behavior:
    *   `downloadImage` function in `UserProfileModal.jsx` (uses `supabase.storage.from('avatars').download(path)`).
    *   `updateProfile` function in `UserProfileModal.jsx` (uses `supabase.from('profiles').upsert(updates)`).
    *   `handleSendMessage` function in `ConversationView.jsx` (uses `supabase.from('messages').insert(...)`).
    *   `UserSearch` component's RPC calls (`supabase.rpc('search_profiles', ...)` and `supabase.rpc('create_or_get_conversation', ...)`).
    *   Image downloading in `Header.jsx`, `ConversationList.jsx`, and `ConversationView.jsx` (if they use `supabase.storage.from('avatars').getPublicUrl(...)` for actual download, not just URL generation).
*   **`viewPinDetails`**: Currently just an `alert()`. Needs a proper modal or page to display full pin details (though `PinDetailsModal` has been implemented, this might refer to further enhancements).
*   **Image Uploads**: While avatar upload is now functional via direct fetch, general image uploads (e.g., for pin photos) still need to be implemented.
*   **Gatherings Board Comments**: While the comments functionality is there, displaying user avatars and full profile details for comments is not yet fully implemented.
*   **WebGL Context Loss**: While handling is implemented, frequent context loss might indicate underlying browser/hardware issues that warrant further investigation.
*   **PWA Install Prompt**: Ensure the PWA install prompt appears correctly on supported devices.
